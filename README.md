# SQL Portfolio

This repository contains analysis using SQL. In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle [Europe Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhurpant/europe-population-data).

## Files:
* **Analysis of population Europe**: [Analysis](https://github.com/Jola2/SQL-portofio/blob/main/Analysis_of_population_Europe/Analysis_of_population_Europe.md) - final and complete analysis
* **Creating and uploading table**: [Tables](https://github.com/Jola2/SQL-portofio/blob/main/Creating_tables.md)

*It is crucial to mention that Russia is not included in the data. Due to the fact that this country has a huge area and a large population, the results in most queries would be different.*
